  Lab 1: Data Types Practice — Using String Interpolation
  Your Name – Date
  Instructions:
  Follow each step carefully.
  Use string interpolation (backticks `` ` `` and ${ }) for every console message.
  Each console.log() should say:
  "The value stored in the variable [variableName] is [value] and its data type is [type]."
*/

// 1️⃣ String
// Declare a variable named studentName and store your name as a string.
// Use string interpolation to log the sentence describing its value and type.
let studentName = "Aaman Ordonez";
console.log(`The value stored in the variable studentName is ${studentName} and its data type is ${typeof studentName}.`)

// 2️⃣ Number
// Declare a variable named studentAge and store your age as a number.
// Use string interpolation to log the sentence describing its value and type.
let studentAge = 16;
console.log(`The value stored in the variable studentAge is ${studentAge} and its data type is ${typeof studentAge}.`)

// 3️⃣ Boolean
// Declare a variable named isEnrolled and assign it either true or false.
// Use string interpolation to log the sentence describing its value and type.
let isEnrolled = true;
console.log(`The value stored in the variable isEnrolled is ${isEnrolled} and its data type is ${typeof isEnrolled}.`)

// 4️⃣ Undefined
// Declare a variable named favoriteSubject but do not assign it a value.
// Use string interpolation to log the sentence describing its value and type.
let favoriteSubject;
console.log(`The value stored in the variable favoriteSubject is ${favoriteSubject} and its data type is ${typeof favoriteSubject}.`)

// 5️⃣ Null
// Declare a variable named nextClass and set it equal to null.
// Use string interpolation to log the sentence describing its value and type.
let nextClass = null
console.log(`The value stored in the variable nextClass is ${nextClass} and its data type is ${typeof nextClass}.`)

// 6️⃣ Check
// When finished, run your file to verify that all outputs print correctly.
// Run your file by typing node index.js in the terminal

// 6️⃣ Commit & Push
// Save your work and push it for grading
